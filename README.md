# ATmega328_Timer_Interrupt_Calculator
This is a C# program that calculates the appropriate timer values for an Atmega328 microcontroller. It allows users to input the desired time or frequency, as well as the clock speed of the microcontroller. The program then calculates the necessary prescaler value and outputs the corresponding timer and compare values.

The program also dynamically creates buttons to display the available prescaler options, and recalculates the timer and compare values when the desired prescaler is selected.

This GitHub repository contains the complete source code for the program, along with any necessary resources such as images or documentation.

Contributions and feedback are welcome.
